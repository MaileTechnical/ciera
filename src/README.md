## To build the compiler from source:

### Dependencies

#### `bridgepoint` and `mc` repositories

Clone `bridgepoint` and `mc` onto your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/xtuml/bridgepoint.git
git clone https://github.com/xtuml/mc.git
```

In `src/pom.xml`, update the `bpLoc` and `mcLoc` properties to point to the
correct file location on your system.  By default, they are expected to be
located in a directory called `git` in your home directory.

#### pypy

The Ciera build uses the `pypy` Python interpreter for its prebuilds. `pypy` is
significantly faster than standard CPython and saves a lot of time in builds.
`pypy` installation is optional.

To install on Linux:
```
sudo apt-get install pypy
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | pypy -  # install pip for pypy
```

To install on Mac:
```
brew install pypy
```

If you choose to use CPython, you must remove the line:
```
<pythonExecutable>pypy</pythonExecutable>
```

from `src/tool-core/pom.xml`, `src/tool-sql/pom.xml`, and `src/tool-template/pom.xml`

#### pyxtuml

pyxtuml (>= 2.2.1) is required to build the source projects. It can be installed with:

```
pypy -m pip install pyxtuml
```

or if you already have an older version of pyxtuml installed:

```
pypy -m pip install --upgrade
```

If you are using CPython instead of `pypy`, install with:

```
python -m pip install pyxtuml
```

### Build

```
mvn install
```

Building Ciera is a relatively memory hungry task. On some systems, it may be necessary to increase
the heap size Maven is allowed to use.
```
export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1g
mvn install
```

### Creating a dev workspace

Install the latested BridgePoint [nightly
build](https://s3.amazonaws.com/xtuml-releases/nightly-build/buildfiles.html)

Set the `BPHOME` environment variable to point to your BridgePoint
installation.

Run the workspace auto-setup script:
```
bash create-workspace.sh <workspace_location>
```

If no `<workspace_location>` is provided, a temporary directory shall be created.

### Creating a release

1. Set release version
   ```
   mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<version> -DgenerateBackupPoms=false
   git add .
   git commit -m "bump version to <version>"
   git tag v<version>
   git push
   git push --tags
   ```
2. Build and deploy release
   ```
   export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
   mvn deploy -Prelease
   ```
3. Push to maven central through sonatype
   - Login at https://oss.sonatype.org/
   - Navigate to "Staging Repositories"
   - Select the repository and click "Release"
   - Copy the link to the Redmine release into the description box and confirm
4. Create github release
   - In Github, edit the tag and copy in the link to the Redmine release from
     the issue tracker.
5. Set next development verion
   ```
   mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=<version> -DgenerateBackupPoms=false
   git add .
   git commit -m "bump version to <version>"
   git push
   ```
   `<version>` should be the next SNAPSHOT version. As the default, increment
   the third number from the release version and add "-SNAPSHOT".

### Publishing the API docs

1. Clone the `cieradoc` repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/xtuml/cieradoc.git
   ```
2. Create a new folder in the `apidocs` directory with the same name as the
   release version (e.g. `apidocs/2.0.0/`). Make a directory `runtime` within
   the new version directory.
3. Copy the contents of `src/runtime/target/apidocs/` into the new folder.
4. Update the symbolic link `latest` in the `apidocs` directory to point to the
   new folder.
5. Commit the changes and push.
